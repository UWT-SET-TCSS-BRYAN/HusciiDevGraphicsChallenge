# Huscii Developers Graphics Challenge

IntelliJ Project

Main: src/edu.uw.tcss.app.Main.java

Challenge: 

In ui.CanvasPanel.java, calculate and draw an arrowhead that points to the Target (centered-purple circle)/ 

Notes: 

* Click on the Source (blue) circle and drag it to move. The line adjusts accordingly, and so should the arrowhead. 
* The arrowhead is represented by the instance field myArrowHead. Feel free to change the type. Path2d?
* Add the calculations and adjustments to the method adjustArrowHead. Feel free to add Parameters and/or use access to instance fields. 
* In paintComponent, myArrowHead is currently displayed by the Graphics2d.fill method. Feel free to adjust.
* Use the images found in the assets folder as reference. Note that these are hand-drawn to give you an idea of the arrowhead, you should not take them literally.
