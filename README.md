# Huscii Developers Graphics Challenge

## Project setup

IntelliJ Project using Java Swing

Main: src/edu.uw.tcss.app.Main.java

GUI: src/edu.uw.tcss.ui.CanvasPanel

## Challenge: 

In ui.CanvasPanel.java, calculate and draw an arrowhead that points to the Target (centered-purple circle)/ 

### Notes: 

* Fork this Repo. When solved, add me to present your eresults. **cfb3**
* Click on the Source (blue) circle and drag it to move. The line adjusts accordingly, and so should the arrowhead. 
* The arrowhead is represented by the instance field myArrowHead. Feel free to change the type. Path2d?
* Add the calculations and adjustments to the method adjustArrowHead. Feel free to add Parameters and/or use access to instance fields. 
* In paintComponent, myArrowHead is currently displayed by the Graphics2d.fill method. Feel free to adjust.
* Use the images found in the assets folder as a reference. Note that these are hand-drawn to give you an idea of the arrowhead, you should not take them literally. But, take note that the arrowhead is OUTside of the target circle. The tip of the arrow should stop right at the edge of the circle.
